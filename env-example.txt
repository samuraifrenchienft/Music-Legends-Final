# Railway provides DATABASE_URL automatically when PostgreSQL is added
# Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Railway automatically sets this when you add a PostgreSQL service
# Leave empty to use SQLite (local development)

# Optional: External PostgreSQL Backup Storage (for long-term archival)
# This is SEPARATE from Railway's PostgreSQL - used for syncing backups to your own storage

# Leave empty to use local file backups only (backups stored in backups/ directory)
# Note: Railway already provides automatic 7-day backups - this is for YOUR custom backup storage
