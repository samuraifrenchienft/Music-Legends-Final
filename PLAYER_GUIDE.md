## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to do anything special to hear sounds?**  
A: Nope! Just click the audio file Discord attaches to the message.

**Q: What if I miss claiming a season reward?**  
A: You can claim anytime during the season, but unclaimed rewards disappear when the season ends.

**Q: Do my cards disappear when a season ends?**  
A: Never! All cards you earn are yours forever. Only the ability to earn NEW season-exclusive cards ends.

**Q: How do I earn XP the fastest?**  
A: Open packs (main source), win battles, trade, and focus on collecting unique artists.

**Q: What's the difference between Level and Rank?**  
A: **Level** = How much XP you've earned total (goes up every 100 XP). **Rank** = Your tier based on total XP (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.).

**Q: Can I see other players' progress?**  
A: You can see their rank and level on the leaderboard, but not their detailed stats.

**Q: Do season-exclusive cards really never come back?**
